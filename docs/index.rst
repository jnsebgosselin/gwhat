Welcome to GWHAT's documentation!
=================================

GWHAT (GroundWater Hydrograph Analysis Toolbox) is a free, open source, and
cross-platform interactive computer program whose main focus is the
interpretation of observation well hydrographs. It is written in the Python 3
programming language and is currently maintained and developed by
Jean-Sébastien Gosselin at INRS_. The source code and a stand-alone executable
for the Windows platform are available free of charge for download on GitHub_.
