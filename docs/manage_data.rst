Data Management in GWHAT

Importing Data
-----------------------------------------------

Before ground-water hydrographs can be plotted or analyzed for a given project,
time series of water level and weather data must be imported in GWHAT.
The format in which the data must be saved, so that they can be imported
successfully, is described in :numref:`input_datafile_format`.

Importing water level and weather datasets in GWHAT is done by clicking on their
corresponding |icon_open_project| icon, in the right side panel of the tab
:guilabel:`Plot Hydrograph` or the tab :guilabel:`Analyze Hydrograph`
(see :numref:`scs_datamanager_panel`).
Clicking on either of the |icon_open_project| icons opens a window named
:guilabel:`Import Dataset`, where a valid water level or weather datafile can
be selected by clicking on the |icon_open_file| icon (see :numref:`scs_import_data_dialog_windows`).

After a valid datafile has been selected in the window :guilabel:`Import Dataset`,
the information relative to the climate or piezometric station, which were
read from the header of the selected datafile, are displayed in the section
:guilabel:`Dataset info`. These information, as well as the :guilabel:`Dataset name`,
can be modified before importing the dataset by clicking on the button
:guilabel:`Import`. The dataset will then be added to the :term:`project file` and will
be referenced in the list of imported water level or weather datasets
(see :numref:`scs_datamanager_panel`) by the name that was provided in the
field :guilabel:`Dataset name`.

Input data files format
-----------------------------------------------

This section describes the format in which daily weather and water level datasets
must be saved so that they can be imported in GWHAT as described in
:numref:`sec_importing_data`.
GWHAT includes a tool to download and automatically save daily weather
data from the `Canadian Daily Climate Database`_ [#url_cddc]_ in the
appropriate format (see :numref:`chap_dwnld_weather`). Moreover,
GWHAT provides an automated, robust, and efficient tool to fill the gaps in
daily weather data records that is presented in :numref:`chap_gapfilling_weather_data`.
There is currently no tool in GWHAT to automatically download and format
ground-water level time series. However, these data can be downloaded
free of charge for the province of Quebec from the `Groundwater Monitoring Network
of Quebec`_ [#url_rsesq]_  and for several canadian provinces from the
`Groundwater Information Network (GIN)`_ [#url_gin]_.

Weather data files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GWHAT can read weather data saved in comma-separated values (csv) or tab-separated
values (tsv) text files with UTF-8 encoding. An exemple of correctly formatted datafile is
presented in :numref:`weather_datafile_example`.

The file header contains information about the station name, province, latitude, longitude,
elevation and climate identifier. The dataset is composed of daily maximum, minimum,
and mean air temperature in Â°C and total precipitation in mm.
:abbr:`nan (not a number)` values must be entered where data are missing.
Data must also be in chronological order, but do not need to be continuous over time.
That is, missing blocks of data (e.g., several days, months or years) can be completely
omitted in the time-series.

    Example of a correctly formatted weather datafile.

.. note:: Preferably, the gaps in the daily weather records must have been
          filled before importing them. Otherwise, a value of 0 is assumed
          for days where precipitation are missing and the missing values for
          air temperature are evaluated by linear interpolation. GWHAT provides
          an automated, robust, and efficient tool to fill the gaps in
          daily weather data records that is presented in :numref:`chap_gapfilling_weather_data`.

Water level data files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GWHAT can read water level data from either coma-separated text files with UTF-8 encoding
or from an Excel spreasheet (:file:`xls` or :file:`xlsx`).
An exemple of correctly formatted water level datafile is presented in
:numref:`water_level_datafile_example`.

The file header contains information about the well name, identifier, province,
latitude, longitude, and elevation. The first column of the data must contained
the time in excel numeric format. The second column must contain the water level,
given in meters below the ground surface. The third and fourth columns correspond,
respectively, to the barometric pressure and the Earth tides.
This will be discussed in more details in :numref:`chap_computing_the_brf`.
