Plotting the Hydrographs
===============================================

This document shows how to produce publication quality figures of well hydrographs
in GWHAT using the tools available under the tab :guilabel:`Plot Hydrograph` shown
in :numref:`scs_plot_hydrograph`. For detailed information on how to import the
weather and water level data in GWHAT, please consult :numref:`chap_importing_data`.

    Presentation of the tool to plot hydrographs in GWHAT under the
    :guilabel:`Plot Hydrograph` tab.

The tab :guilabel:`Plot Hydrograph` consists mainly of an editor to produce a
graph showing the groundwater level time series in relation to weather
conditions. As shown in :numref:`fig_plot_hydrograph_annoted`, the editor
consists of a toolbar, the panel :guilabel:`Input data` 
(documented in :numref:`chap_importing_data`), the panel
:guilabel:`Axes settings`, and a canvas where the hydrograph figure is shown.

A figure of the hydrograph is produced as soon as a water level dataset have
been selected in the :guilabel:`Input data` panel.
It is possible to zoom the figure canvas in or out by pressing the
|icon_zoom_in| or |icon_zoom_out| icon or by rotating the mouse wheel while
holdind the :kbd:`Ctrl` key.

Various parameters are available to customize the layout of the hydrograph:

- Several options are available to customize the size and visibility of 
  the components of the hydrograph in the :guilabel:`Page and Figure Setup`
  window, which is accessible by clicking on the |icon_page_setup| icon.
  This is covered in more details in :numref:`subsec_page_and_fig_settings`.
  
- The color of most of the elements that are plotted in the hydrograph
  can be configured in the :guilabel:`Colors Palette Setup` window, which is
  accessible by clicking on the |icon_color_picker| icon.
  This is covered in more details in :numref:`subsec_color_settings`.
  
- The axis of the graph can be configured in the :guilabel:`Axes settings` panel.
  This is covered in more details in :numref:`subsec_axis_settings`.
  In addition, the |icon_fit_x| and |icon_fit_y| icons can be clicked at any time 
  to, respectively, fit the time and water level axis automatically to the data.

- The |icon_meteo| icon is used to access the :guilabel:`Weather Averages` window
  where are displayed the yearly and monthly normals of the weather dataset.
  This is covered in more details in :numref:`chap_weather_normals_viewer`.

The layout for the currently selected water level dataset can be saved by
clicking on the |icon_save_config| icon. The previously saved layout can be
loaded back for the currently selected water level dataset by clicking on the
|icon_load_config| icon. Finally, the hydrograph can be saved in a :file:`pdf`,
:file:`svg` or :file:`png` format by clicking on the |icon_save| icon.

Components of the Hydrograph
-----------------------------------------------

:numref:`fig_hydrograph_components` presents the various elements of the hydrograph.
Each of these are discussed in more details below.

.. _fig_hydrograph_components:
.. figure:: img/scs/hydrograph_editor/hydrograph_components.*
    :align: center
    :width: 100%
    :alt: hydrograph_components.svg
    :figclass: align-center

    Identification of the components of the hydrograph.

.. _subsec_water_level_component:

Observed water levels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The observed water levels are plotted on the bottom part of the hydrograph. 
By default, groundwater levels are represented by a continuous line that connects 
to all available data.

It is possible to ensure that the continuous line is not drawn over periods
where data is missing by marking the missing period in the water level time
series with at least one ``nan`` value before importing the water level dataset in GWHAT.
For example, in :numref:`fig_missing_water_level`, water levels were missing
for the whole of 2012. A ``nan`` was thus added in the time series
at one time during this period to avoid a line to be plotted between the
31/12/2011 and the 01/01/2013.

.. _fig_missing_water_level:

    :alt: hydrograph_missing_period.png
    :figclass: align-center

    Example of an hydrogaph with an extended period of time for which data is
    missing.
    
As shown in :numref:`fig_wl_trend`, it is also possible to show the trend of
the water level by setting the option :guilabel:`Water Level Trend` to 
:guilabel:`On` in the :guilabel:`Page and Figure Setup` window
(see :numref:`subsec_page_and_fig_settings`).
The actual observed data are then plotted under the trend line as a scatter plot.
The trend line is computed using a moving average window of 30 days.

    :figclass: align-center
    
    Example of a hydrograph where the trend of the water level is shown as a
    continuous blue line along with the real observations plotted as a series
    of light gray dots.
    
.. _subsec_weather_data_component:

Weather data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mean air temperature is plotted in the top part of the graph. The area
between 0ºC and the observed temperature is colored by default to highlight the
periods when air temperature is below the freezing point of water. Mean air
temperature can be plotted on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. This can be changed
from the :guilabel:`Axes settings` panel as discussed in :numref:`subsec_axis_settings`. 

Cumulative precipitation, as rain and snow, is plotted in the bottom part of the
hydrograph along with the water level data. For a given day, precipitation is
assumed to fall as snow if the mean air temperature for that day is below 0ºC and
as rain otherwise. As for air temperature, cumulative precipitation can be plotted on
a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

As shown in :numref:`fig_wl_trend`, it is possible to plot the water level data
alone, without the mean air temperature and cumulative precipitation, by setting
the :guilabel:`Weather Data` component to :guilabel:`Off` in the 
:guilabel:`Page and Figure Setup` window.

Missing weather data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Missing data`` component is used to mark where daily air temperature and
precipitation were estimated due to missing data in the dataset. This information
is read when importing a dataset in GWHAT (see :numref:`sec_importing_data`) from
the :file:`.log` file that is produced automatically when gap filling daily
weather records with the tool presented in :numref:`chap_gapfilling_weather_data`.

.. note:: If no :file:`.log` exists when importing a daily weather datafile in 
          GWHAT, ``Missing data`` markers won't be plotted on the hydrograph,
          even if data are missing in the daily weather dataset.


Water level manual measurements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Water levels measured manually during field visits can also be plotted on the hydrograph.
This provides a quick and easy way to visually validate the automated measurements
acquired with a water-level data logger.

To do so, the manual measurements must be saved in a csv or xls/xlsx file
named :file:`water_level_measurements` in the :file:`Water Levels` folder
(see :numref:`sec_desc_project_folders`).
An example is shown in :numref:`fig_water_level_measurements` below. The first column corresponds
to the name of the observation wells (see :numref:`sec_importing_data`), the second column is the
dates entered in :term:`Excel numeric date format`, and the last column corresponds to
the manual measurements, in metres below the ground surface.

.. _fig_water_level_measurements:

    :align: center
    :width: 50%
    :alt: water_level_measurements.png
    :figclass: align-center

    Example of a :file:`water_level_measurements` file.

.. note:: A :file:`water_level_measurements` file is created in a csv format
          by default by GWHAT the first time a project is created. If desired,
          this file can be converted to a xsl or xslx format. Note that if more
          than one file named :file:`water_level_measurements` exists in the folder
          :file:`Water Levels`, but with different extension, GWHAT will always
          read the data from the csv file by default.
          
Water level envelope predicted with GLUE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Water levels predicted by optimizing a quasi-two-dimensional hydrologic model
with the GLUE (Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation) methodology at
the 05/95 uncertainty level can be plotted on the hydrograph once groundwater
recharge have been evaluated with the tool presented in :numref:`chap_est_recharge`.

As for many other elements of the hydrograph, the plotting of the GLUE
predicted water level envelope can be turned on or off
in the :guilabel:`Page and Figure Setup` window.

.. _subsec_page_and_fig_settings:

Page and figure settings
-----------------------------------------------

Several options are available to customize the size and visibility of the various
components of the hydrograph in the :guilabel:`Page and Figure Setup` window,
which is accessible by clicking on the |icon_page_setup| icon
(see :numref:`fig_plot_hydrograph_annoted`).
The :guilabel:`Page and Figure Setup` window is shown in
:numref:`fig_hydroprint_page_settings`, along with an annoted figure where are
presented the various components of the hydrograph layout that can be
configured from this dialog.


.. _fig_hydroprint_page_settings:
.. figure:: img/scs/hydroprint_page_setting.*
    :align: center
    :width: 100%
    :alt: hydroprint_page_setting.svg
    :figclass: align-center

    Presentation of the components of the hydrograph for which the size or the
    visibility can be configured in the `Page and Figure Setup` window.


.. _subsec_axis_settings:

Axis settings
-----------------------------------------------

The scale and range of the axes for time, water level, and weather data can be
configured from the :guilabel:`Axes settings` panel, located on the right side
of the hydrograph editor. The options that are available for each axis are
presented in :numref:`fig_hydroprint_axis_settings`. The hydrograph is updated
automatically when a value is changed in the :guilabel:`Axes settings` panel.

.. _fig_hydroprint_axis_settings:
.. figure:: img/scs/axis_parameters_annoted.*
    :align: center
    :width: 100%
    :alt: axis_setup_annoted.svg
    :figclass: align-center

Time axis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The range of the time axis can be changed by setting the :guilabel:`From` and 
:guilabel:`To` dates. The :guilabel:`Scale` of the time axis can be set to
`monthly` or `yearly`. The :guilabel:`Date Disp. Pattern` setting allows to define
the interval with which the tick labels of the time axis are plotted. Four different
cases with different values of the :guilabel:`Scale` and The :guilabel:`Date Disp. Pattern`
settings are presented in :numref:`fig_hydroprint_axis_settings`.

Water levels axis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :guilabel:`Minimum` setting of corresponds to the value at the bottom of
the water level axis. The :guilabel:`Grid Divisions` value corresponds to the 
number of intervals in which the water level axis is divided as shown on
:numref:`fig_hydroprint_axis_settings`. The :guilabel:`Datum` of reference of
the water level axis can be set to either ``Ground Surface`` or ``Sea Level``.

The value at the top of the water level axis is calculated from the values
specified in :guilabel:`Minimum`, :guilabel:`Scale`, and :guilabel:`Grid Divisions`.
The equation that is used in the calculation, which depends on the :guilabel:`Datum` that
is selected, is presented at the bottom of :numref:`fig_hydroprint_axis_settings`.

Weather axis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only the scale of the axis for the precipitation is configurable through the
:guilabel:`Precip. Scale` setting. The minimum value for precipitation is always
set to 0 and the range of the axis depends on the value specified for the setting
:guilabel:`Precip. Scale` and :guilabel:`Grid Divisions` in the water level axis
settings.

As discussed in :numref:`subsec_weather_data_component`, the :guilabel:`Resampling` setting is used to set the time scale on which mean
air temperature and cumulative precipitation are plotted on the graph.


.. _subsec_color_settings:

Color Settings
-----------------------------------------------

The color of several components of the hydrograph can be changed from the
:guilabel:`Colors Palette Setup` window, which is accessible by clicking
on the |icon_color_picker| icon (see :numref:`fig_plot_hydrograph_annoted`). The
:guilabel:`Colors Palette Setup` window and the components of the hydrograph for which
the color can be changed are both shown in :numref:`fig_hydroprint_color_settings`.
A new color can be selected for a given component of the hydrograph by clicking
on its corresponding colored square in the :guilabel:`Colors Palette Setup`
window and by clicking on the :guilabel:`OK` or :guilabel:`Apply` button.
