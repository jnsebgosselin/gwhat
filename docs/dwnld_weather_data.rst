Downloading Daily Weather Data
===============================================

This document shows how to search, download, and format daily climate data
from the `Canadian Daily Climate Database`_ (CDCD) using the download
weather data tool of GWHAT available under the tab ``Download Weather`` shown
in :numref:`gif_dwnld_weather`.

.. _sec_download_weather_data:

Downloading weather data
-----------------------------------------------

Daily weather data can be downloaded automatically for one or more stations at
a time simply by selecting them in the table shown in :numref:`dwnld_weather_annoted`
and by clicking on the |downward_arrow| icon in the toolbar.

Climate stations can be added to the table either by selecting an existing list
of stations from a file by clicking on the |open_file| icon or by using the
`climate stations browser`_ by clicking on the |magnifying_glass| icon.
Climate stations can be removed from the table by selecting them and clicking
on the |eraser| icon. The list of stations can be exported to a :abbr:`csv (comma-separated values)`
file by clicking on the |save| icon, so that it can be directly loaded in successive sessions of GWHAT.

When clicking on the |downward_arrow| icon, daily weather data are downloaded
between the :guilabel:`From Year` and :guilabel:`To Year` values specified for each selected
station and the results are saved as csv files in the Raw folder of the current
project. The downloading process can be stopped at any time by clicking on the |stop|
icon that appears in the toolbar as soon as a downloading task is started.
Weather data for a given station will not be downloaded for the years for which
a data file already exist in the Raw folder. Finally, the :guilabel:`From Year` and
:guilabel:`To Year` values can be set individually for each station or for all stations
at once using the |set_fromyear| and |set_toyear| icons as shown in
:numref:`set_all_fromyear_toyear`.

.. _climate stations browser: `Searching for weather data`_

Searching for weather data
-----------------------------------------------

The climate station browser shown in :numref:`cdcd_browser` provides a graphical
interface to the CDCD_, which contains daily data for air temperature and precipitation
dating back to 1840 to the present for more than 8000 stations distributed across Canada.
The list of stations can be filtered in the browser by proximity, province, or/and the
number and the range of years for which data are available at each station.
For example, :numref:`cdcd_browser` shows all stations with at least 10 years
of available data between 1960 and 2017 that are located less than 25 kilometres
away from the specified lat/lon coordinates.

Stations can be added to the table displayed in the :guilabel:`Download Weather` tab
by selecting them in the browser and clicking on the button |add_to_list| `Add`.
Alternatively, the selected stations can also be exported from the browser to an
Excel or :abbr:`csv (comma-separated values)` file by clicking on the button |save| `Save`.

.. _sec_weather_datafiles_format:

Formatting the weather datafiles
----------------------------------------------------------

After all data have been successfully downloaded for a given weather station,
GWHAT automatically format the data and displays information about the number
and the proportion of days with missing data in the the right-side panel of
the :guilabel:`Download Weather` tab (see :numref:`format_weather_panel`).
It is also possible to open and format previously downloaded weather data files
by clicking on the button |open_file| `Select` at the top of the panel. 

It is possible to navigate through the datasets that were formatted over the
course of a given session using the left-right arrows and save any dataset
manually by clicking on the button |save| `Save` button.
By default, GWHAT automatically save the formatted data in a single :abbr:`csv (comma-separated values)`
file in the :file:`Input` folder of the current project folder. 
It is possible to prevent GWHAT from automatically saving the formatted dataset
by unchecking the :guilabel:`Automatically save formatted weather data` option
located at the bottom of the formating tool.

    Presentation of the tool to format raw weather datafiles located in the right
    panel of the :guilabel:`Download Weather` tab.

The formatted weather datafiles are utf8_ :abbr:`csv (comma-separated values)` text
files. An exemple of formatted datafile is presented in :numref:`weather_datafile_example`. 
The file header contains information about the station name, province, latitude, longitude, 
elevation and climate identifier. The dataset is composed of daily maximum, minimum, 
and mean air temperature in Â°C and total precipitation in mm. 
:abbr:`nan (not a number)` values must be entered where data are missing. 
Data must also be in chronological order, but do not need to be continuous over time. 
That is, missing blocks of data (e.g., several days, months or years) can be completely 
omitted in the time-series.
