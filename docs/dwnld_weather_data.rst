Searching for weather stations
-----------------------------------------------

Before data can be downloaded from the CDCD_, climate stations must first be 
added to the table of the `download weather data` tool. This is done by clicking
on the ``magnifying glass`` icon, which open a new window where it is possible
to browse through about 8450 climate stations distributed across Canada with 
available daily data for air temperature and precipitation.

    Online CDCD_ (Canadian Daily Climate Database) browser.

The list of stations can be filtered by proximity, province, or/and the number 
and the range of years for which data are available. For example, 
:numref:`cdcd_browser` shows all stations less than 25 km kilometres away 
from the specified location with at least 10 years of data available between 
1960 and 2017.

Stations can be added to the `download weather data` table by selecting 
them in the browser and clicking on the button ``Add``.

The info of the selected stations can also be exported to an 
Excel or CSV file by clicking on the button ``Save``.

Downloading the weather data

Daily climate data can be downloaded automatically for all the selected weather
stations by clicking on the ``downward arrow`` button in the toolbar.
