    The weather station list contains the following information:
    station names, station ID , year at which the data records begin and year
    at which the data records end, the provinces to which each station belongs,
    the climate ID and the Proximity value in km for the original search
    location.

    All these information can be found on the Government of Canada
    website in the address bar of the web browser when a station is
    selected. Note that the station ID is not the same as the Climate ID
    of the station. For example, the ID for the station Abercorn is 5308,
    as it can be found in the following address:

    http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?timeframe=
    2&Prov=QUE&StationID=5308&dlyRange=1950-12-01|1985-01-31&Year=
